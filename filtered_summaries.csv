Ive never attempted it, but I feel like the only reason I dont do it in these bouts of depression is because I know my parents would be sad and because I love my dog. I know it would break their hearts and ruin their whole lives if I did do it, and it would hurt some of the people at my work for sure, but it would just make everything so much easier.

"Hi so some background information first, I have a combined personality disorder with depression, anxiety and emotional instability. I am having depression issues for half my (27f) life and taking meds for over 10 years now.

My current episode started in the end of 2019, I have been in stationary therapy last year and in rehab this year, but it seems like I just do not recover from this depression.  
I am at the point now, that I am more and more tired of my life. I am not able to work, lost my phd position and literally can not do anything. My sleep rythm is awful. I do not know how to carry on. I am not getting better while staying at home.

Since I am becoming suicidal my therapist wants to talk to me tomorrow about another hospitalisation. And there seems to be my problem, I do not know if it is a kind of fear or else, but some part of me does not want to go back into that hospital. There have not been any bad experiences or something like that, the people there were great and really helpful, I even found some friends. 

I am so stuck, in the depression, in my situation, in my own thoughts. I do not know how to stay alive. I married this year, I should be happy, but I am not. I just dont want to live anymore.

Sorry for the long text, I just needed a vent",I have been in and out of hospital over the last year and a half because of depression and I am now at the point where I want to take my own life.,0.6447709202766418

She also seems to be suffering from depression, though I am no psychiatrist.
