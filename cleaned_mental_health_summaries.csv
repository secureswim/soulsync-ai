"I don’t know why I did it. The negativity I had been feeling was clearly overwhelming and I was left with the desire to cause extreme harm to myself. I came out of it with a broken ankle (which some consider to be lucky) but really the emotional effects after surgery and countless therapy sessions has taken a toll on me. I tried to end my life during this time period but I was successfully unsuccessful. 

To this day I am still trying to understand it and understand myself. If you’re reading this, I want you to know that I’m okay. However, I am at a stalemate and if I get better I want to remember these feelings and know that I was able to overcome this despite feeling like I can’t at this moment.",Last year I attempted to take my own life by jumping off a balcony.
"Ive noticed that a lot of the time when im depressed ill generally get suicidal thoughts. Ive never attempted it, but I feel like the only reason I dont do it in these bouts of depression is because I know my parents would be sad and because I love my dog. I know it would break their hearts and ruin their whole lives if I did do it, and it would hurt some of the people at my work for sure, but it would just make everything so much easier. Obviously these arent normal thoughts to people who are always happy with everything going right in their lives, but im curious out of those who are depressed is it a normal or common thought? Even if you dont attempt to go through with it or plan to, just the thought of it.",I have been having a bit of a hard time lately with my depression and I have been wondering if anyone has ever had suicidal thoughts?
"I’m sitting here with a gun in my hand. my household is so negative, I feel like nobody is satisfied with anything I do. I can’t ever express my emotions to anyone because I come off the wrong way to everyone.

"I dont really know why I do it, it does help I some ways. It doesnt make me anymore productive, it clouds the thoughts. Yes it clouds the useful ones (I haven't touched any uni work in about 8 weeks) but it also makes it harder to think and obsess over the bad ones. 

Also I think I just want someone to notice. It's probably not the smartest way of going about it. But I don't know how else to say I'm not coping",I've been doing this for about a year and a half.
"Recently I have been having more and more thoughts about if I am depressed, and I need some help with what I should do. For most of my life I have suffered with bullying, due to my ADHD, people find me either too much to be around, or an easy target because I bite when It comes to insults. I'm 20 now and still find this to be exactly the same, even in my job. My personality has changed where I feel lifeless, I care less and less about my health and more of how to distance myself from everything and everyone, I spend time wanting to cry but just never feeling able to, I find it hard to even smile at things I used to enjoy so so much. Most of the time I sit and think about just wanting a hug. No one around me seems to understand me, and I'm unsure of what to do with myself.",I'm writing to you because I'm struggling with depression.
"Hello all, is anyone able to give me advice on how to best support my girlfriend who struggles greatly with depression? 

I am currently making sure that our home is clean and trying my best to make a lunch for her every day and listening when she is open to talking but I need some help supporting her better. 

She doesn’t have any family to lean on, and she has a hard time reaching out to friends.

"Basically I was trying to flirt with him and he told me he wants to flirt back but flirting causes him to fall in love quickly and then he told me he’s not ready for a relationship because it’s bad timing.

And now it’s been 2 days since we talked and part of me wants to believe him but part of me thinks he’s just saying that to reject me nicely.

And tonight I was cutting my thigh with a blade and thinking of him while I did it like wtf. What is wrong with me.",I’m in a relationship with a guy and he’s not ready for a relationship with me.
"since the very end of 2016, haven't hugged anyone or can I say that no one ever gives me a hug？feels like I can not trust anyone wholeheartedly, and knowing that nobody has the responsibility to accept my negative emotions and trash feelings, I don't deserve them to do so. feels terrible when you know that all the flowers will perish and kept thinking why bother planting those flowers at the beginning to just see them die anyway ？

I don't even wanna share those mental shits with anyone, cuz it makes me feel bad and guilty, why should I make someone feel sad about my mental situation while im already suffering from depression ？

I know all those theorises about how you should fight against depression but I just couldn't act ！just like a guy who broke both of his legs and he just couldn't fucking walk, and those ones around him just keep telling: ""be strong and learn to walk "" 

man, imma losing my mind, depression doesn't kill me like a bullet through the head but it kills me everyday, holding a knife and everyday slice a piece of meat of my flesh ,then I got numb while bleeding and suffering 

I don't wanna off myself, but it's just damn painful from inside

"I used to like her, pretty sure she used to like me, I fumbled and pussied out when she was all over me, and since then we’ve just been friends but I’ve liked her. We used to talk everyday then a few times a week than once a week then to j whenever I was even more depressed than usual. Last week I told her abt my cutting habits and that everything was getting worse and I probably shouldn’t even be talking to her bc I quit weed when we liked each other or I think we did so I thought I could rely on her for happiness and about a month ago I knew I couldn’t. She has always been incredibly kind and had my best interests at heart and been a really good friend I’m just really confused now and wonder if I did something yet again or if she is all the bad things I noticed but abnormally pushed to the back of my mind",I’ve been friends with this girl for about a year now.
"I need to feel something, i feel im pure void right now, i don't care what the feeling is, from intense pain, love or a drug idk i just need something that makes this void disappear, this sensation of emptiness i have is to much to handle, right now i feel like im just flesh with nothing inside.

"For about a month and a half now I’ve reached one of my lowest points I’ve had in years. I’ve made multiple large mistakes at my job and I feel like I can’t stop making them. I’ve had multiple fallings out with close friends. I feel like I’m in this pit I can’t dig myself out of, and every step I make feels like a potential land mine. I have this deep heaviness in my chest that’s just making me dread everything. The day ahead of me, going to sleep, waking up. My husband is so unbelievably supportive, but I can’t bear to lean on him so much because I know it affects him. I don’t even feel I have a right to complain because I know others have much worse issues, but I also don’t know what to do with myself. I’ve been through years of therapy so I have the tools to not let myself completely sink into the pit, but every day it feels more and more hard even try. Nothing is comfortable, nothing is warm. I’ve barely been showering or brushing my teeth or hair. I’ve stopped exercising. I have so many responsibilities to my family and I’ve been completely frozen and unable to do anything. I don’t even know what I’ll get out of this post, I’m just so horribly and desperately sad.",I’m writing this post because I’m so desperately sad.
"I feel, at this point in my life I should be better. It feels like I’m not even piloting myself at so many times. I fall back into this deep depression and often that translates to anger. I feel horrible as I come off spiteful or selfish, and it makes it worse when I know deep down the only thing I could be good at is art. Im a failure, a selfish brooding shithead that can’t get anything right. What do I do when I can’t land a job or make money from the only thing im good at? Work another shitty job that caused me to damn near overdose on a frequent basis? No, I don’t want that, and I feel ill never reach peace or comfort with myself, or my art. 

To make it worse I can’t even do schoolwork and digital commissions(not that I even get many) as my laptop screen doesn’t work and is cracked.

"I was doing so well mentally and physically ever since August. I even stopped taking my meds (Aripiprazole) because of how well I was doing, I didn’t think I needed it anymore. Everything was going great in my life. Loving family, good friends, decent income, and overall just good lifestyle.

I felt the sadness slowly creep up on me last night and I usually ignore it since I’m fine the next day, but it’s just stuck with me all day today. It’s affecting my productivity and my social skills. I don’t know what to do because I feel my brain going crazy with so many thoughts of irrational things I want to do.

"I (29F) have had on and off depression for as long as I can remember and further (while my memory of it doesn't go that far back, I've seen photos of myself from when I was 10/11 with signs of self harm)

It will come in phases, and not always linked to stressful situations. The past year has been very full of life stress (work, love, relationships) and while it has been difficult I have not been depressed. However, last year, when these stresses weren't in the picture, for 5 months I was severely depressed and spent most of that time in bed, with no energy to do much else but sleep and sob.

These episodes come in phases, and when I come out of it I can't explain the feeling, it's like one day I wake up and just have the energy again and I'm up and out the door. They have lasted sometimes only a couple of weeks, sometimes will go on for months, there doesn't seem to be consistency.

I'm at a place now where I'm really trying to work through it and work out where it comes from. I have only ever tried therapy this year, but only very short term due to the expense.

Speaking with my only support person, they are of the stance that this kind of episodic depression is always rooted in something that happened. I've always rejected that approach, as as far as I can remember there have been no distinct traumatic events that have happened in my past.

I'm wondering from anyone who has a similar experience, and began the healing, is there always a traumatic root to these moods and phases? 

TLDR; is there always a traumatic root to long-term episodic depression?",I have been suffering from long-term episodic depression for the past year.
"Hey everyone, 

Hope you’re all doing well. So, I just had a doctors appointment and I made the appointment in the first place because I wanted to talk about ADHD because I know for a fact I have it. 

The doctor came in introduced herself and asked me why I’m in and I don’t know why, but I just started crying. I told her I think I have ADHD but there’s some other stuff going on as well. 

She started asking me a lot of questions, nicely, and then at the end of the questions and talking to me for a while, she said that she really thinks I need to be on antidepressants. She said she sees this everyday and can tell. She said I checked off 7/9 of the symptoms/indicators of depression that they have to ask. 

Is it normal to prescribe antidepressants on the first doctors meeting? I’ve also never been on antidepressants before so is there anything I should know? Should I stop smoking weed while on antidepressants? Is it safe to take them if my diet is really not that well (university student so I eat a lot of junk. Not overweight though)

Any tips would be beneficial. Thank you all",What do you do if your doctor prescribes antidepressants on your first doctors meeting?

Even after I told him I was not interested and that it made me uncomfortable over and over again and told him to stop. Then I told HR and they talked to him and he still continued. Then I went to HR again and they talked to him again. But this time, I got angry and asked for a different HR person as I did not understand why we were still working so closely together. This new HR did a whole investigation and read all messages and interviewed people and concluded that it was 100% harassment. They then fired him. And now I feel awful.

I am not sure I am in the right place or what to do but I thought I should start somewhere.

I have been struggling with my mental health for a while but the last year has been brutal. I barely sleep, I am angry all the time, I have frequent crying spells, and I have trouble functioning. I have zero motivation to do, well, anything. I am supposed to be completing some online schooling but I can't even bring myself to go to the website. The prof has reached out but I can't even bring myself to open the email. I feel guilty, embarrassed, you name it.

I also struggle with dealing with people and the state of the world. I feel overwhelmed, angry, helpless, etc.

Basically I am here to ask how I start to get help and if there is any help for this. I was recently diagnosed with adult add/adhd combination and have a psychiatrist assessment booked soon.

I am wondering who I should talk to about this, is there a certain type of therapist I should see, certain medication I should consider, is there hope?

I am so tired of feeling angry at the world and helpless at my place in it.

I am also wondering what treatment is like?

I know I should go to sleep on time, exercise, eat right, etc. Knowing isn't the problem, I just can't seem to force myself to take the steps to do anything and I am worrying that counselling is just going to be another to do list I struggle with.

The closest thing for my reason for existing is to make others inadvertently feel better about themselves by comparison to my pathetic life. Quite literally can’t do the most basic things in life correctly and I’m sure that’s made someone feel great, knowing they don’t have to lives a life as worthless as mine. At least that’s what I’d think for anybody who happens to pay any mind to me. 

Craziest thing about this is, I’m not even depressed I’ve just come to terms this is the life given to me and there’s nothing I can do to change it despite my best efforts. That doesn’t mean I’m fine with it tho, just me submitting to reality.",I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m not worth anything.

"As a 50 year old guy who has no other close family or friends and no life I'm alive only for her. But she's 80, has parkinson's and has become physically dependent on me for a lot. 

While she is still somewhat mobile her ability to handle her personal needs is probably coming to an end within the next 2 years and her mobility will probably be such that she will need assistance with everything. 

So she will need to be in a nursing home as I cannot care for her at that level. But I know how miserable she will be if that happens. She has already started giving upm I hope she dies before it gets that bad so she does not have to suffer anymore than she currently does.

But one thing I suspect is that once she passes away I won't be far behind. To be honest the day she passes away the pain in shock of it could literally give me a heart attack and kill me. But if it doesn't happen right then and there I hope it happens within a year of that because I don't want to live past that point.",I'm writing to you because I'm worried about my mother.

I have a friend who had a hard depressive case mid last year followed up by a life/professional crisis.

Thankfully nowadays most of the crisis has stabilized and he/she is leading a healthier life as far as I can tell.

I finally went to a psychiatrist for the first time and I am starting Prozac 10mg tomorrow (for one week then have been instructed to increase to 20mg). Does anyone have any advice? I am a pretty heavy drinker and drink frequently throughout the week and wanted to know if I should try to avoid alcohol completely as this is my first time taking medicine so I’m not really sure what to expect. Has anyone had any positive/negative experiences with this - just a little nervous about it all.,I have been suffering from depression for the last year or so and have been told by my GP that I need to take Prozac.

Nobody has ever been real with me.,It’s time for me to give up on this thing called life.
I can’t be happy for 1 day. If god exists he and the devil are kicking the shit out of me while I’m down. The times I’m happy are just a setup for my life to take a nosedive.

I don’t even panic or feel anxiety in terrible situations. I’ve been in them so times I just let them happen. I don’t even feel anything on the inside. But to everyone else im all smiles and jokes. This weekend is my birthday and like every year for the last 10 it’s going to be one of the worst days of my year.

"You ever wonder what it would be like, if you were happy? Like, you didn’t have to deal with all these negative thoughts? I’ve wondered that. It must feel good. I just don’t know how to get there.

I hate telling people I’m fine when I’m not. I’m tired of sayin I’m sorry when it’s not my fault. I’m hate saying it is what it is when I’m asked about my feelings or mental health. But it’s all I can do. I’m too scared of telling anyone about it. It’s not like they care.

I’ve been putting on this mask for so long I’m getting tired. I can’t even hide it anymore. Still, nobody cares. Whenever my friends aren’t around to hang out, I text them. “How are you doing?” Or, “Where are you at?”. When it’s me, there’s nothing. I’m sick of it.

I don’t even do anything, these days. I walk aimlessly around my house, I sit at my desk staring at my computer screen. I lay on my bed just listening to music. That’s it. God damn it. I haven’t cried in years.

Why? Please tell me why? I’m so tired of this.","I don’t know what to do with myself, I don’t know what to do with myself."
"Do You Deserve To Be Happy?

I saw this trending as a search and I thought it was an interesting topic. Instead of answering the question, it will be far more fruitful to actually explore the question itself. 

There’s quite a bit loaded into this question, primarily the implications that people do or don’t deserve happiness. The idea here being the way we act and live should or should not make us worthy of happiness. That is a very, very strange premise.

Imagine asking if you deserve to be afraid, or if you deserve to be sad. How about disgusted or excited? “Deserve” is not a word typically used with emotions, and even when it is, it’s an unrealistic relationship. Our emotions are generally responses to situations. Yes, we can control these situations to a degree, and accordingly moderate some of our responses, but this is very different than ‘deserving’.

So, long story short, it’s not whether you do or don’t deserve happiness. It’s about what you’re doing to produce happiness, and how you can change your actions to produce even more happiness. Feeling unhappy is a normal, expected part of life but you do have influence to a degree. Accept what you can’t change and work toward what you can. That’s far more useful than trying to determine if you ‘deserve’ a particular emotional state. 

Has the idea of ‘deserving’ kept you from experiencing happiness?

"title speaks for itself tbh, i’m not depressed, i passed that a while ago, now i’m completely dead inside. my one source of happiness was a girl in my class that i was in love with. i found out that she was giving me false hope, she would text me something nice that made it seemed like she cared, and then she would ignore me for 7 hours. the saddest thing is that she’s been doing this for a while no, i’d say for around a month, and i know that that’s what’s she’s doing, but i still tried to start conversations with her as it was the only thing that made me happy. this morning i had my last straw with her, i told her how i really felt, as per usual she left me on seen for 3 hours, then she said she was sleeping and asked me how i slept. i responded and once again she didn’t respond after 3 hours. so i blocked her.

I am a student, have a part time job and flatmates that would accept animals. I was thinking about adopting a cat as a way to deal with depression. My family home cat helps me a lot, but he is in another city and with my parents and my relationship with them is complicated at best.

"Hey all,

So I'm relatively new here but wanted to ask a question that I have been seeking answers for for the past couple of days. I have struggled with depression for about five years and about a week and a half ago, I was finally able to get on some meds that are supposed to help me to feel better. While I am still in the process of them kicking in, I had a question come to my mind. I have been living with depression long enough that it has caused some unhealthy habits, especially with my eating. I use it as coping for just about every emotion (and as a result I have had significant weight gain), so now that I am supposedly going to start feeling better, I figured I should get ahead of the curb and try to figure out how to get over those bad habits that happened as a result of my depression so they don't keep me going back into that mindset.

"I (24F) have been working on my degree since I was 18 with no success. I simply settled for community college bc I procrastinated and panicked. I hadn’t even really planned on living through my senior year.

"I know all of this may sound odd and confusing, sorry.

5 years ago after a very bad depressive episode, I almost lost my life. I was a very alienated teenager and felt like I didn’t fit anywhere. “Creep” by Radiohead was my song lol.

After that I went back to the country where I was born and spent my early childhood years, where I met all the relatives I hadn’t seen in years so I got better and actually felt like I could be happy like other people my age.

When I came back to my current country I decided to completely change my personality to look “normal” and live a “normal teenager life”. I began acting stupid, carefree like a total airhead. I stopped having straight A’s. I pretended I had a huge crush on a guy I didn’t even like. When I told my friends about him I always acted like the stereotypical 14-year-old.

After those “manic” 6 months I felt completely alienated from myself and ended up losing my friends. Turns out they didn’t actually like me and talked shit about me behind my back, saying that I was too stupid and annoying.
I went back to my “old personality” but now feeling deeply ashamed of the way I acted.

I spent my whole teenage years feeling like I had 28292 different personalities and having really a lot of existential crisis lol.

Things have got better now and I feel more “myself” now, though in social contexts I always end up acting differently and have the feeling that sometimes that’s not me. It’s very confusing.",I’m a 20-year-old woman who was born with 28292 different personalities and has spent my whole teenage years feeling like I had 28292 different personalities and has the feeling that sometimes that’s not me.

And it expects me to stay

Then a darker place it would be

And I must make the choice today

To practice what I preach.

And others all around me

Only makes me feel more stuck

Just gotta get this off my chest. This fact at least applied to myself. So when I thought I have found someone only to be disappointed later I realised this very fact isn't going to change.

The disappointment is just so much that I don't even know how to fix myself anymore even if I bawled my eyeballs out.

I am not even sure where to begin... For months I've been struggling to cope with my mother passing from COVID-19 then my father moves on with another woman days later. The worse part is that I'm trapped living in our childhood home since last year due to the pandemic and my financial situation deteriorating. My wife and I are struggling to find a place to live as every other day he threatens us by saying things like he's putting the house on sale within a month then extends to 6 months. He goes back and forth on that and it's an unstable environment. The worse part of it all is the realization that I grew up in a very dysfunctional religious family. I'm on antidepressants and I'm not even sure if it's working for me but I'm able to atleast read other stories and hold strong knowing you all are going through it too. If anyone lives down south in Florida I am sure you know the struggle is real.

"I've missed two therapy appointments in a row. I'm such a fucking failure. I've wasted my therapist's time, the office's time and my dad's money. I don't understand why I can't just... do the things I'm supposed to do. Why can't I just REMEMBER the shit I'm supposed to???

I don't even know why I'm going to therapy. It's not helping. It's not doing ANYTHING. Every session is the same. I talk about my intrusive thoughts, I talk about my panic attack, I'm given advice on how to combat these things and then I just... don't do it

I already owe close to $600 dollars to this office, money which neither I or my dad has. Maybe it's a good thing I've missed these appointments. I'm 100% sure my therapist isn't gonna take me back after this screw-up. I can work to pay off the money I owe and then just, I don't know, wash my hands of this.

God, I feel so fucking miserable about this. I just want to apologize to my therapist, but I don't even want to bother her. I know I've wasted her time, and she's probably so disappointed with me.

“Normal” people do have aims or goals or things to live for, but people like me, we don’t. I’ve accomplished literally everything I’ve ever set out to do.

Now I would love to give something back, because it took so much effort to start therapy, sticking with it, quit drinking and smoking weed and generally becoming a stable person after believing there was no hope for me ever in life for more than a decade. 

But I don't know how. Two persons that I went to school with killed themselves over the last 2 years. One just about 2 weeks ago. Now I really want to help with what I can. Not on a professional level but as someone to talk too and share the story. But everytime I try to apply for a support group I get afraid. I am afraid to get back to my old habits.

I took him for food even though he didnt appreciate it most of the time. He would never say thank you, and would moan about it.

I sent him quotes and messages throughout the day so he could feel happy and safe.

My eyes are growing heavy ready for a night of torment, I’m sure of it. The only question is how many episodes will it be before I give up? Last night it was 4. They were horrific. Generally the medication helps with that. Yesterday it felt like they had taken on the role of an amplifier.

So tired of being tired raises the question;

How much pain will there be in the fall? If the answer is none then sign me up.",It’s been a long time coming but I’m finally ready to give up.
"Hi, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m a 20 year old male junior in college, and I can’t help but cry after every semester is over because I don’t want it to end.

I live with my best friends and we all go to the same college. We all met freshman year. We started rooming together sophomore year. Ever since the first semester of sophomore year I cry after every semester ends and I don’t know why.

We hang out and smoke weed and pursue our goals together during the semester, but suddenly one day it all ends and suddenly I’m back home, reminded that I’m one step closer to graduating and having to separate from my guys permanently.

I think corona might have had a hand in this feeling but I really don’t understand why I start thinking like this. We were all we had while we did college during corona. Even so, it’s just a semester ending. Can someone help me understand",How do you feel about the end of a college semester and the beginning of a new one?
"So I've been doing a little better the last few weeks.. I think.  

My depression's feeling a little more stable and than my usual 'manic highs' in the pendulum swing, but I'm getting more 'urges to cry' in exchange.   like all the time.  Mostly to music, of all kinds. Not always sad songs, and not always a sad cry; sometimes just an outpouring of emotion.  

Curious if anyone's felt this kind of swing or had any thoughts on it","I've been having a bit of a 'manic high' in the last few weeks, but I'm getting more 'urges to cry' in exchange."
"I’ve struggled with severe to suicidal depression for over a decade and this was a helpful tip from a therapist. 
I hadn’t eaten food or drank any water that day before our virtual session and she told me to go get a glass of water and some to eat while we were talking. She introduced me to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. 
Ultimately, what I can say about this is that if you can address one of two of these primary needs (at the bottom of the pyramid) — if you can! — on a really low day, you are helping yourself and getting your basic needs met.

I'm tired of feeling like a failure at home, knowing that I could be the husband and father they deserve if I could just pay a little more attention to them. I'm tired of feeling like I'm failing at work because I just can't concentrate more than 50-60% of the time.

I’ve been depressed for 4 years but I feel like it’s gotten worse. I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I lost both my grandparents this year. My mom has cancer and is going through chemo. None of my siblings are in happy or healthy relationships. I’m taking care of my mom and my two sisters while working and going to school full time. I feel as though nothing is getting better. The days where I wish I can go to sleep and not wake up are coming more often. I know I don’t want to die but I’m tired.

Im not working right now because of anxiety (im working on it with a therapist) and I have no idea what I want to do with my career, I have no hobby’s or friends. It feels like I actually have no identity and I’m so grateful for my husband but I don’t want to be putting so much pressure on him all the time.

I haven’t attend university for more than 3 months so will most likely fail. 

All this in just a few months.


I just want this all to end. I just want it to stop. I just can’t take it anymore. I just want to leave. 

When my cat got sick they said euthanise him as he’s in a lot of pain. Why can’t I get that understanding?  Why can’t people say “oh, she was in a lot of pain. She tried but it was easier to let her go” . Why can’t people accept that I’ve waited since I was 7/8 for this to “get better” but nothing has changed. Nothing has worked.

Or option C, just wipe anything/everything to do with me from existence.",I'm in a bit of a limbo like existence right now.
"I just feel grey. I don’t want to do anything. Not even something as simple as watch tv or listen to an audiobook. I’m tired but I can’t nap. I don’t feel like seeing or talking to anyone. I just don’t feel like existing anymore.

Not that I wanna die, I don’t want to hurt my loved ones and I have a lot in life to be grateful for (which makes my feeling depressed even worse). I just don’t want to be conscious. If I wasn’t 7 months sober right now, I’d probably be blackout drunk but instead I’m just sorta wishing I was, so that I wouldn’t have to experience reality. I’m too depressed to even leave my house and break my sobriety though.

I don’t know what to do other than lie in bed… I’ve been seeing psychologists and have been on antidepressants for the past couple of years (although have been struggling with depression and various treatments on/off for at least a decade) and I can’t seem to shake it.

"Minor depressive episodes before Covid hit, especially in high school. But I worked hard to get it under control. Lots of therapy and self evaluation and self improvement. I worked so hard for a good job, GF, I was super motivated. 
Gym grind really kept my depression in check. 
I was in the gym 7 days a week no exception. 

Covid hit. Lost my job, relationship, gyms shut down, at the same time as a shoulder injury. Put me completely out of commission. It all went to hell at once. 

Lost literally everything I had in life. Even all my friends ghosted me.

Leaving a funeral isn’t the place the place for inspiration for life, or not for many people.

"Hey guys. How do you deal with being robbed of perspective? My particular depression currently is the result (I strongly believe) of benzo withdrawals.

What is the point? Why am I alive? And why can’t I just off myself? Why does every single neuron in this dumb ape brain scream in protest at the mere thought of harming myself? St least then it’d be productive, at least then I wouldn’t be sitting on my ass.",I’m sitting on my ass and I don’t know what to do with myself.
"being suicidal but knowing someone who’s commit is the worst thing in the world. bc you see both sides. you see how it affects the people that love that person. including yourself. you see how it doesn’t end the pain but it just passes it on to all the people who are left to deal with it. but then it also makes it so much more understandable as to why someone did it. you know what it’s like to want the pain to end. the feeling of your brain sabotaging you and your happiness constantly. to stop feeling like you’re drowning in yourself. 

you get each and every point to it.
and in a sense… it makes me feel even more guilty for ever having the thought in the first place. for it becoming my “safe space”. knowing that if things don’t fall into place that i’m okay with not being here anymore but not being okay leaving the people you love to clean up the mess / carry it with them for the rest of their lives. 

sorry. end rant.",I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what it’s like to know someone who has taken their own life.

"22 F/ been struggling with depression/BED/ panic disorder/anxiety majority of my life. I’m trying my best to work it out through therapy. There was a point in my life where I had 14 cavities all at once and it’s embarrassing to admit I wasn’t taking care of myself for a long while. My therapist suggests journaling and using the calm app, those things do help me only some of the time. I feel like I’m slipping into old habits again and it really makes me more anxious because I don’t want to go back to that darker time. I’m trying to do things I love like reading a lot and being outside again. I’ve lost interest in a lot of my old hobbies like playing guitar, baking, cooking, painting, drawing.. those are all things I used to do for fun but when I try to do them nowadays it just doesn’t  feel right and it feels forced. I feel like I’m making myself do it to distract myself. My therapist told me I tend to “fight” my depression instead of “accepting it”. Maybe they are right the moment I start to slip into old habits I try to shove it away because it makes me anxious. Does anyone have any tips on how they can regain interest in their old hobbies/ find new ones? Or does anyone have experience dealing with this type of bad slump? I’m no longer suicidal like once was years ago but living without anything to look forward to is getting tiring.",I’m 18 years old and I’m struggling with a bad slump.
I’m tired of feeling less and less of a person. Lately no matter how hard I try I can’t escape the feeling that it would be better if I wasn’t around. I know that people care about me and I care about them but I’m tired of living this burdenful life. It seems like everyone has a lie to keep and resentment to harbor. I just want to feel good enough for once in my life even though that’s too much to ask. One day I’ll stop this affliction I’m facing and cease to exist in a world that doesn’t see me.,I’m tired of living in a world that doesn’t see me.
"8 months ago, the woman I loved and called my best friend left me to be with the guy she was cheating on me with. As an individual with aspergers I assumed I was meant to live my life alone, devoid of true blissfull intimacy. She changed that and made me feel like I was someone who could enjoy life and have friends. We lived together for 4 years and had been together for 6. Last we spoke since she left she told me “We were never even friends to begin with.” All the trips we took, all the things we shared, all of it was evidently a “trick” to live with me. Since then every girl has told me I’m too nice or a pushover. I cant help but want to be nice to people because I know what its like to be hurt and I’d never want to do that to someone else. Ive becime convinced that im simply unloveable. The one selfish thing I want is to sleep and never wake. And I can’t do it because of the pain it would inflict on my brother. Hes most likely going to be drafted into the MLB this coming year and my plan was to do it shortly after that so that theres no way my selfish act could derail his career and life goals.

"My 12 year old sister just showed me her scars, and told me that she has been cutting herself for the past year. She did vaguely hint at it a few weeks before but I didn't know how to deal with it and still don't. I guess seeing the scars solidified it. 

She also seems to be suffering from depression, though I am no psychiatrist. Her grades have been dropping, she doesn't do the basic self-care things like showering enough, and tends to be a lot more on edge now. Maybe it's puberty? I am noticing these signs a lot more than the rest of my family because I started cutting myself when I was 11, too (I never let her know about any of this. She just knows that I got therapy this past year). 

I'm not sure how to tell my parents about getting therapy for her because while she is open to the idea, I doubt that they will take it seriously when she's so young, especially because my sister told me to not mention the self-harm. I need some advice on how to approach my parents for this because I'm afraid of things escalating for her, the way they did for me.

I’ve been in excellent shape before, but this didn’t help, and in fact made me insecure because girls finally liked me. I went to college, but failed out of my program despite taking advantage of all of the resources available to me and trying my best (engineering). I then switched to a different major but found that not very easy either and failed multiple classes.

I wish I could've let her know that while she's alive. I know life isn't fair but what the fuck?,"I've been having a really bad week, I've been having a really bad month."
Me(19) and my GF have been together 5 years and all through these 5 years i have have been in a very bad state of depression and suicidal thoughts. just a couple weeks ago she had to go to other side of the world in an emergency to support her family there. i have never coped well alone and being so far away is only making me worse. anyone who may have experienced anything like this if they could give some tips would help.,I'm 19 years old and I'm struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts.
My wife complains to me about things like forgetting to turn off lights or not cleaning up well enough and it’s just I feel all these pains and I try to help but it’s just never good enough and idk it makes me feel like I wish I were dead. Idk how to make it make sense I’m not trying to make excuses but I do things like leave cabinet doors open or leave out trash and it bothers her so much but I basically have a migraine constantly and usually feel dizzy and I wanna do better for us but idk now anymore. I plan on exercising starting tomorrow but what do I do about now? I feel useless. I get my $3300 va check which allows me to work but I can’t bring myself to do it and I know she wants me to work cause we could really use the money rn but I wouldn’t be able to get thru a shift. I kinda wanna die tbh.,I’ve been having a lot of headaches lately and it’s just getting worse and worse.
"I've struggling with depression and anxiety for most of my life, although things have gotten much, much worse since having kids with special needs. I've since tried a variety of SSRIs and SNRIs, although nothing has significantly helped. I'm on Cymbalta now, and maybe it ""takes the edge off"" a little bit, but I don't feel noticeably better.

I've always seen a lot of people talk about antidepressants causing ""numbness"" or emotional blunting. Typically it is referenced as a bad thing, but that's exactly what I'm looking for. 

I know it's probably not the healthiest attitude or desire, but I really just want to be emotionally numb at this point. Hopefully temporarily- I think there's some hope our situation will improve in a couple years.

How would I go about doing this? Are there particular medications that are good at emotional blunting? Or does it mostly just come down to increasing dosage?",I'm a 30-year-old mother of two young children.
"About a year ago I lost a very large amount of money and ever since Ive felt pretty badly depressed. I have been rather unhappy since age 14 or so but the past year Ive felt a lot worse, I almost committed suicide. 

The most prominent aspect of my depression is that I can hardly focus anymore. Also learning new things is almost impossible because my learning mechanism seems to be 100% broken by the depresssion. 

I used to be pretty smart and a fast learner which allowed me to ace through school without any effort despite my shitty mental state. I always saw my raw intelligence as the ace up my sleeve that would help me go through life but now I think Ive lost my natural potential.

It feels like my brain is constantly foggy and its driving me nuts. It that something that will pass or is this permanent? Does anyone else have such symptoms?",I'm 18 years old and I'm suffering from depression.
"I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past 5 days. I've been diagnosed with moderate depression but if this is moderate depression I'm so sorry for anyone who has to deal with depression on top of other mental illness because this is unbearable.

I'm not sure if anything triggered these negative emotions exactly but I will say none of my friends have been speaking to me for the past week and they all know I've relapsed.. I'm not seeking attention I just don't want to feel so lonely. I see people hanging out and I never got an invite. I don't understand that. It makes me think like what did I do?

When I say I relapsed I mean I struggle with addiction I relapsed on heroin/fentanyl.. I know other people who struggle with addiction but I wouldn't call them friends just people I get high with. This means I have no one to relate to as far as addiction goes. I feel guilt everyday. I've been lying about staying clean and it's shitty. I went to rehab in may and I had 3 months sober. I was eating better and working out at the gym 5 or 6 days a week while working a job. I also was going to therapy at this time and getting a shot called the vivitrol shot.

I just need HOPE. I feel absolutely hopeless like I'll never make new friends or get a girlfriend or find joy or be successful. Getting clean again seems really hard at the moment and I know for me to make any progress mentally I have to but I can't cope lately. If it wasn't for my mother I would just kill myself right now, I have plenty enough dope to do so.",I'm 20 years old and I'm struggling with addiction.
"The only person I can feel comfortable talking to is my boyfriend, if he leaves the room I can’t talk to any of my friends, I can’t even talk to my parents properly without feeling extremely anxious and shitting words from my mouth trying to fill the awkward dreadful silence, I can never meet new people either unless I’m drunk which I am everyday now, if friends come over I have to buy booze, if I go out I have to buy booze, I know I’m an alcoholic but what else am I supposed to fucking do ? People are terrifying tbh, when I went into uni like 3 fucking times I just sat there for the whole lesson thinking about how I was breathing weird and what I looked like then I just start sweating really bad , tbh I’m laughing writing this because it’s just pathetically funny at this point, does anyone else feel the same way ?",I’ve been going to uni for a year now and it’s the worst thing I’ve ever done in my life.
"I've never done anything like this before regarding mental health so please bare with me. I've just been so stressed with funds and taking care of my family.  I'm currently working part time 8pm-2am M,W,F,S,SU. On top of that I'm a stay at home mom during the day with my high energy almost 2 year old. As of right now I barely see my husband because he's either at work or gaming. He's a pretty good dad but has the patience of our kid. I just had to leave my prior and higher paying job during normal business hours because my kid was getting sick constantly and my work couldn't deal with all my missed time. They told me if I called out again they'd have to let me go so I got this new job asap and quit. I'm not getting much sleep and can barely eat anymore. I'm just over it. I know things will get better but why does this part have to be so goddamn hard?",I've been struggling with mental health issues for the last few months.

"i graduated high school june 2020. Before that i had applied and gotten into my dream program in a post secondary institution. It ended up not working out as everything moved online. I ended up getting a job november 2020. I told myself it’d just be until the pandemic died down. I thought I would be able to get back on track with my education soon enough… I ended up loving my job and the people i work with. in september a situation happened with my coworkers that made me feel like they didn’t value me. it got resolved and everything was okay for awhile. but in the past week i’ve just been sad. sad that all my friends from high school are getting to live out their dreams at university. i also feel like maybe the situation from september wasn’t as resolved as i thought? i feel like whenever something goes wrong, my coworkers automatically assume it was me. I feel like my coworkers secretly despise me but won’t say it to my face. it makes me very sad as i view these people as somewhat my friends. i’m not sure if i’m reading into situations too much and they aren’t really mad at me or if i’m catching onto real things that are happening. I feel like i’m looking into things too much, especially because these feelings are popping up at the same time as the feelings about university. im also scared that i’m going to be stuck at this job for the rest of my life. as much as i love my job, i cannot see myself doing it forever. so i guess if you have advice i’d appreciate it!! thanks for reading <3",I’m writing to you because i’m feeling sad about all my friends getting to live out their dreams at university.

My eyes feel heavy and not attached to my body, I feel like I’m living in 3rd person. 
My lower chest hurts, near the tip of my sternum. The air begins to feel ‘musty’ and thick, FEELS hard to breath. Everything feels like a joke, nothing feels real when this occurs. This is what it would feel like if you soul left your body, it’s weird.

Today at work I felt like I stopped dead in my tracks and my body kept moving. Everyone seemed to be so happy and completely unaware of life itself. I guess you could say they were ‘enjoying the moment’. I all of a sudden felt like these people have absolutely no clue at how much I hate myself, completely oblivious to the possibility of me disappearing and that no one would care either. Everyone would move on. 
I’m aware I am not the center of anything, in fact, I despise attention. Otherwise I’d tell family or friends about this, or at least tell them I don’t like myself. I almost wanna say this is like really bad anxiety?

For context I've never gotten a A in english my whole life. Yeah my life is pretty fucking miserable. This year is a fucking mess just like the last two. Later after two weeks I find out I got a solid A in english. I was being serious with that promise. I got so depressed around that time I was very capable of killing myself.

My grades were shit. No matter how fucking hard I tried, I was stuck in the same place. I was stuck with the idea that I couldnt go up the ranks for so long. I knew I was gonna get the same grade, that’s why I made the promise. This was the only promise that backfired on me

The world wants me to live, somehow. From then on I told myself not to give up. I’ve realised my grades don’t matter and I would be alright.

"From what I've read, depression involves not enjoying things you've once enjoyed. I've come to a point where it feels like music is the only thing keeping me sane and alive, and I quite enjoy listening to music, it's the only thing that can give me a sense of genuine happiness.

I've talked to a therapist before (not my personal therapist, someone who is a therapist but it wasn't an appointment/part of their job to talk to me or anything) and I was told that I likely have major depressive disorder. That being said, it's not like I'm diagnosed since I just talked to a therapist once, but I do feel that depression, or at least depressive symptoms, feelings and emotions have taken over my life in the past 4-5 years.

But back to the point, there are days when I have sparks of happiness with those around me, but it just doesn't feel genuine. It feels temporary and kind of forced because I don't want to drain people out by being emotionless all the time. Music is the only thing making me happy at times, depending on what I listen to, but yeah.

"I saw a post about a person losing their best friend cuz they were themselves while being depressed and it’s sad but i have to say that it is true.

People will give you weird looks and you’ll be left out and ignored and called a freak and you’ll probably get bullied too and there will be nothing you can do about it without getting professional help.

Depression is an illness and it can’t go away on it’s own it can only get worse. For example if u don’t treat cancer it’ll get worse and it’ll spread and the same thing will happen with your depression so you’ll either have to get some help or wait until it’s too late it’s on u to choose.",I’m writing this post because a lot of people are talking about depression on social media.

when i have to act happy I’m just being fake, I just see shit for how it is and maybe that’s why i have this outlook. I try to tell myself the old cliche “oh it’ll get better, tomorrow’s a new day yada yada” idk why I tell myself these things when I don’t feel any truth to it. at a loss . I think abt suicide daily but really don’t think I would ever do it.I feel like I want to do it but am too pussy to actually do it.

"I feel like i’ve dug myself into a hole that i cant get out of and there is a boulder of emotions crushing me to death. I’ve drifted away from most of my friends, i only really have one that i talk to almost every day, she’s nice and pretty, i had a big crush on her but i was scared to ask her out but that window has closed because she has a girlfriend now, it sucks for me but at least i still have her as a friend. 

I have a few friends im less close with, they’re fun to hang with in school but i dont hang with anyone out of school anymore because i kinda isolated myself away from my good friends, hopefully they’ll forgive me soon so we can be close again.

Im not doing the best in school rn, the classes arent hard im just too depressed to do homework. i only have counseling/therapy a few times a month so its hard to manage my emotional state.

See ya.","I’ve been having a lot of emotions lately, i’ve been feeling sad, depressed, anxious, angry and scared."

I don't know why I forgot this fakt but now I can clearly remember when I had the plan and how I wanted to do it. In the last ~8 years I often have been depressed but I cant remember for how long, I only can remember some feelings and plans how to do it. Nowadays I get these thoughts again and it last for about 1-7 days.

"My brother (23m) just had a sever depressive episode in which he confided in me that he has seriously been contemplating taking his life. I think it was triggered from a girl not responding how he’d like to his attempts at getting with her.

He’s always been an outsider and has poor social skills. He’s been working very hard and doing Manuel labor for 5 years and has never really had a break as our father is somewhat strict.

He feels trapped and that he’ll never be able to recover from this, it’s as if he’s actually never really known who he is.

Hello,  from 3-4 years i have periods with no sleep for 8-9 days at all and if i  don't get a sleeping pill (zopiclone) it will continue maybe. Im in  this period now for like 2 months, i don't feel well. My heart beats  fast, my blood pressure is low, sometimes is 90 on 40, sometimes is 150  on 50. If i sleep for 4-5 hours everything is good, life is good and  only little bit short term memory issues stays.

Through  previous periods some medications helped, but for 1-2 weeks. I mean  strange medications like nasal sprays, 1 mg melatonin. I had one 2 month  period with almost no issues at all with water an little bit salt.  Water and sugar helped for only 2 days. Strange.

Had  done MRI, they found maxilary sinusitis and something linked with  gliosis changes but they said they are small and should not be linked  with my problems.

My routine is - i  go to work - 8-5 and after finish working i get home, resting, go out  if my heartbeat is not high, get back, resting, watching tv, finger  crossed to sleep.

I lie in bed  from 10 pm to 7 am with eyes closed and nothing, nothing. Just feeling  every heartbeat in my whole body and thats it. Im not feeling like i  need to sleep at all, im not feeling like i even need to blink that  much. 26 years old.

Any help is appreciated.",How do I get a good night's sleep without having to take a sleeping pill?

"i finally decided to take an online depression test this week to see if i was actually depressed because i thought it was normal to feel sad,empty and hopeless in daily basis. 

about an year ago i talked to my friends about how sad i was and maybe i was diagnosed with depression but all my friends were laughing and they didn’t believe me because i seemed okay in real life. they told me that depression is so much more than just being sad.

this week, i took 3different tests and it felt like the questions described my life. all of them turned out really bad and told me that i needed professional help lol. i was surprised because i always thought i was just “sad” and it wasn’t a big deal when i was actually diagnosed with depression since middle school and i didn’t even realize it.

people tend to perceive people with depression to show their sense of isolation even when surrounded by people but i think it really depends because im really energetic and loud when im around people but once im alone, i completely change.

Ik weight increases and decreases and I'm used to it, it isn't my first rodeo, but something in me broke today, maybe the fact that I wake up everyday at 2.30 am to go for a run, or the fact that I have had dinner two times over the last 3 months and have restricted myself to the bare minimum for so long without having any kind of results just destroyed me. 

I tried to puke whatever I ate, but nothing came. I tried to take a leak, but nothing came, and I just cried, well tried to, haven't been able to cry in atleast 12 months now.

On 450 mg of Wellbutrin and 10 mg lexapro. Haven’t felt any differences besides sexual side effects and vivid dreams. Also not sure if meds are working or if I just can’t tell they are working if that makes sense. 

I tried to kill myself a couple of months ago by drinking a large bottle of vodka within a short time period but failed to do so. Wish it had worked. I still want to not be alive but am scared of the pain of dying, feel guilt about effect on others and just don’t have the energy to do it. 

I feel hopeless yet have a very small sliver of hope that some medication will kickstart me to see the point in living so I can start spiraling in the opposite direction, but I’m pretty sure I’m stuck like this and will just have to force myself to do things without caring at some point.

I’ve become totally run down by this after so long that I just don’t even care anymore.and now in the last year I’ve been diagnosed as epileptic which just humiliates me even more.

"Lately i’ve been having on and off sadness for unknown reasons. Sometimes I wake up okay and I progressively just more angsty. Some days I wake up just so out of it I sleep all day. I hate it so much because it feels like I’m stuck in a cycle. I thought I was getting better but you know depression just sneaks around the corner and brings you down. I’ve had the reoccurring thoughts of suicide over the past few weeks but I remind myself there’s people that would miss me. I just hate that it just doesn’t feel okay right now and I want to give up so bad. 

I’ve been overthinking about a lover/crush. I try to calm my nerves but just telling myself that the assumptions i’ve made have no solid evidence to be true of false. It just sucks because I know we both have our own busy lives but I don’t want to feel like i’m over stepping a boundary by always wanting to talk. It’s just a situation where I don’t know how to handle and i’m trying to figure. It’s also one I don’t know how to talk to someone close to me. 

That’s another thing. I’m scared of the people around me because i’ve had my trust betrayed before in the past. 

I’ve been on antidepressants for awhile now and it just feels like they’ve helped me a little bit but I still feel this aching pain inside. I’m not a drinker but i’ve had the urge to drink more often just to feel happy but it’s something unhealthy I don’t want to do to myself.

when i have to act happy I’m just being fake, I just see shit for how it is and maybe that’s why i have this outlook. I try to tell myself the old cliche “oh it’ll get better, tomorrow’s a new day yada yada” idk why I tell myself these things when I don’t feel any truth to it. at a loss . I think abt suicide daily but really don’t think I would ever do it.I feel like I want to do it but am too pussy to actually do it.

"You're right, others do have it much worse. I have no reason to be depressed by the childhood trauma I went through. It gave me cptsd & bpd but that's nothing compared to others. The random flashbacks of memories that make me break down from time to time, or me waking up in a cold sweat after reliving nightmares only to immediately get sick is just me wanting attention. 



I know my life means nothing to you, if I died it would likely be used as internet points until there's nothing to gain from it anymore. Then it's back to normal.  It's sad that I can already see the several (please send ME love) videos. Most people would go quiet for a long time on socials & maybe make 1 video explaining the silence, but I know that's not you. You've proven that to me multiple times.

I cut my wrist yesterday and cut a tiny bit today. At first I thought they would be unnoticeable but I decided to actually look at my arm and saw that I already have 26 cuts on my left arm.

But honestly at this point I don’t even care anymore, real friends set up real plans with you and don’t only invite you to go out partying and drinking with them, they’ll invite you to go to a hike together etc.

But i’m not ok. I don’t know how i’ll figure things out. I don’t know how i’ll make it through this tough time.

The bicycle should arrive on December 1st.

On the evening of the 24th, I received an SMS that my order  363139597  was canceled.

This upset me a lot.

Support said that LPT did it.

I don’t know what it is.

They were out of work in the evening, and all of Thanksgiving too.

Eventually I decided I wasn’t good enough to buy things from their store. Apparently my $ 400 is worse than other people's money.

Today I was able to speak with LPT. They checked my address and said that now I can order again.

But this new order will no longer arrive on December 1, it will come much later.

I will have a lot of time to think about my life, whether to continue it or not. Thank you LPT Overstosk!

"I’ve had Depression most of my life. Seven attempts and two trips to the psych ward. I am also a vet, and suffer from severe sexual assault PTSD. The guys that did it are free, ruled not guilty. I had no other reason to live before the trial. I really wanted to get them behind bars. When that fell through, I lost hope again. The person that stuck with me through the entire thing is my best friend and, now, husband. This was a year ago. Ever since, I’ve been unstable. I can’t trust anyone, and my depression has hit its lowest. I do not want to attempt again (very painful) and I cannot legally access anything that could do it quickly (from past trips to ward). This has left me so much time to contemplate. At the end of the day, when I lie my head down, and thoughts of death are constant, the only thing that can ease the pain is my cat. Strange, but no person can help, not even my husband. Animals on the other hand, always manage to crawl under my skin. They are innocent and cannot understand why their owners are gone. When I look at my cat, I see the purity of her heart. It pains me to think I’d leave her. So, to this day, I say: when she dies, so do I.

"Lately my dreams and memories merge together and I'm not sure what was real and what wasn't. I know memory loss is a symptom of depression but I never had this level of confusion. For example, I went to work yesterday but I can't tell for sure if I did give a customer a free sample of cat food if I dreamt it.

It's been happening a lot lately and it's starting to get scary. I'm young (22) so I don't think it could be a memory disorder or something like that.",I'm having a bit of a problem with my dreams and memories.
"Not even sure if this is the right place to post about this ( even though I'm pretty sure I am depressed ( well I know something is wrong with me )) but I'm wondering if this is causing me issues. I prefer when people are just being themselves that way I can judge them fairly . My only problem is it makes me see a lot of motivations I would consider negative in people i.e ( people trying to get close to me to get close to someone else, someone motivated by guilt / feeling bad for someone / feeling like owing them ect ) . Is this bad think to think of ? This is literally an important idea in my life and and day today decisions so if it is bad how would I stop ?",I'm trying to stop judging people by the way they look or the way they act.

Just had a breakdown just now .. came here to vent and I’m hoping someone can talk to me. Basically I just vented to my boyfriend about me not having no interest in living and that I want to die soon.. I have no interest in working because I believe that people were not meant to work and we should be free. I drag myself to work and it sucks. I just want my thoughts to end completely. I stress about insomnia even when I do sleep. I feel bad for people who have mental illnesses and sleep disorders. Days without sleeping and possiblity of going crazy? Makes me so scared. I don’t want to go through that .. ever. How do people not kill themselves over it??? I just need someone to talk to me and see if anyone can relate to me.. thanks","Hello everyone, I’m 18 years old and I’m struggling with depression."
It’s very hard to even want to take care of myself at this point. I keep wanting to find more reasons to keep going but none of them feel good enough. It’s just so hard to do anything these days. I can’t make myself happy and all I want is to be happy.,It’s been a long time since I’ve written a post like this.
"I’m 19. I have a well paying, low stress, remote job. I have a girlfriend. I have a lot more money than most 19 year olds. I’ve gotten a scholarship to the college I’m going to. I have a great circle of friends. I have everything I could want.

It’s easy for me to list these off because it’s an exercise I’ve been putting myself through - where I list all the good things about my life. And then it doesn’t help. 

Recently I just haven’t been functional. It’s hard to sleep. It’s hard to even get out of bed and even then, it’ll just be to sit at my desk because I’ve finally convinced myself to get up. I’m terrified of going outside. I avoid every responsibility I can. It hurts to say it because I’ve always taken pride in my hygiene, but I’ve barely been showering or brushing my teeth either.

I just don’t understand what’s happening to me. There’s no root cause I can pick out or anything, it’s like I just feel this way for no reason. 

I’m terrified of reaching out to anyone so I thought I’d post here. I just want help.",I’m writing to you because I’m struggling with depression.
"It’s so hard to explain but I’m gonna try. I basically get random waves of what I can only explain as emptiness, where for a short period (could be minutes) I feel sick, loss my appetite, feel sad and just empty . I have no idea why this randomly comes over me and I have no idea what it is. Can anyone else relate?. It used to come in spells but now I feel like it’s all the time. I don’t know if it’s anxiety or what it is. All I can explain is feeling empty and when I say that to a professional they’re normally confused by what I mean. It’s frustrating because it randomly comes over me without me even thinking about anything and it’s an awful feeling!",I’ve been having this weird feeling of emptiness all the time.
Idk what to say got nothing no one will care what I have to say this post will get little to no attention so idk why I'm making this but I might as well do it anyway I'm considering suicide but I'm conflicted if I do it i will bring so much pain to others but if I don't do it I will continue to suffer I dont have real friends I don't have a future I'm triggered by animal Crossing porn and people make fun of me for it even after I say I was forced to watch it while raped and on top of that people are completely ok with baiting little kids to watch porn and calling that a meme I don't want to continue in a world where it's normal to get kids into porn or where people are terrible to each other ik this post winter get attention because it's to serious compared to the top post where they talk about how they are squidward and shit and ik this won't get attention because no one gives a shit,I'm making a post about how I'm feeling because I'm triggered by animal Crossing porn and people make fun of me for it even after I say I was forced to watch it while raped and calling that a meme I don't want to continue in a world where
"I feel like I have a disease, for years I can't get rid of this thing. I opened up, I go to therapy and thank god I'm not suicidal anymore, but the remnants of this still haunt me.
I get so much shit from other people and everytime it throws me back","I've been through a lot in my life, I've been through a lot of depression, I've been through a lot of suicidal thoughts."
"Every night I hope to not wake up. Recently lost my job and because of an extensive background of problematic alcohol use getting a new job always worries me. 

I mentioned these to a neighbor. 

Last night because my apartment had been dark more since I am bad about turning lights on while focused on the computer (finding a job, and it is getting dark at like 5pm) and going to bed earlier (8 instead of 12, depressed) they checked in to make sure things were okay.

Super nice to know there are people out there who seem to care sometimes.

And they are moving out of state at the end of the month, oh well.",Every night I feel like I am not good enough to go to bed.
"I cry in the bathroom at work, I cry in my apartment, I cry when I visit my parents. This year I've hit a different level of depression.  Been hospitalized 3 times inpatient  and 3 outpatient. I cant afford a therapist anymore, I dont have health insurance starting January 1st, my family doesn't know how to help me anymore. I dont know how to help myself anymore. My quality of life is non existent now. Im almost 25, and over half of my life I've been in and out of the mental health system. I've had enough.",I've been suffering from depression for the last year and a half.
I’m in my head and it’s really bad and I just want to die I’m constantly being bullied at home and I can’t remember that last someone gave me a hug and said your worth something or I love you and had actions behind it. I have these constant replays of my family or friends telling me everything wrong with me. How I just need to toughen up and I’m a lazy person. I know it’s my depression but I still hate myself to the point I feel like I’m a liability to the world. I just want to feel loved… ❤️‍🩹,I’m 17 years old and I’m struggling with depression.
"The future is the scariest thing. Atleast to me.
I have many people I love which I simply don't want to see die. I lived with my grandparents and visit them every weekend, but when I do I just stay on my phone and don't talk to them. I live them very dearly and the thought of them dying terrifies me. I want to talk to them but I fail to get the courage to start a cknversation. I just want to go and sit in my grandmas lap and ask her to tell me a story. I want to die before them. Im 15 and don't want to grow up. All the responsibilities of being an adult terrify me. I feel like I'm not ready and never will. I'm never ready for anything. I want to kill myself but the thoughts of my family and the aftermath keep me from it. However I think it's better to just end it as fast as I can so I have less of those thoughts. I'm barely hanging on and I'm not sure how long I'll last.",I'm 15 and I'm scared of the future. I feel like I'm not ready and never will.

"I’ve been depressed since I was around twelve for multitude of reasons like getting raped, losing most of my friends, never opening up, etc. Every time I feel like I’m getting better or if anything good happens mentally I kill it. I want to feel sad, numb, etc. I want my mental well-being to get worse. Why am I like this?",I’m a 17-year-old girl and I’m depressed.
"Hey guys, I'm not really sure what I'm expecting here but I feel like I need to ""talk"" about this or atleast just put it into words.

I have never been diagnosed with any sort of depression but all signs point to it these days. I'm a married man, father of 2 wonderful kids and I'm quite happy with my home life. I play video games, I host a weekly d&d session with friends, disc golf etc.

Well I just had a 4 day business trip out of town, the whole way back I was feeling off but just figured it was jetlag. Now that I'm home I suddenly have no urge to do anything I used to find entertaining. I have just spent the weekend sitting around doing nothing. 

Like I said, not expecting anything but wouldn't mind hearing what you have to say.",What do you think about people who are having a hard time with depression?
"Just tired of being alone tired of poverty and long work days tired of the mockery I just want to feel the warmth of a woman.

"I don't know what to do my depression and anxiety has gotten so bad that i can't have a clear mind anymore so when I wake up all these thoughts race my head and I get dizzy and nauseous so basically haven't gone to school once since Nov 1  but i didn't do so good in October either, when I'm not at school I feel anxious when I am at school I feel anxious and depressed, i don't now what to do",I'm 15 years old and I'm struggling with depression and anxiety.
"my physics lecturer asked me why i was doing so poorly compared to last time he saw me and i just did it, i told SOMEONE on the edge of crying because i was so anxious and mad. 

i said ""i have bad anxiety:.....he smiled and scoffed ""your mind is weak""

okay thanks, \*walks out and punches a wall thinking how stupid i was for that and embarrassed, my knuckles bruised and inflamed up 10 minutes later and it hurt like fucking hell, i continued to walk and punched every pole and wall i saw that day.",I was in my final year of university and i had a bad day.
"At this evening I've come to realization, that my depression may be so severe, because when I was a child I was never really talking about my feelings with anyone. I don't know why, I had a friend I could trust, but I was just too embarrassed to say anything about being beaten and bullied by my own mother, feeling a little bit neglected by father etc. As a little shithead I thought that suppressing all my emotions is OK and nothing bad can happen because of it. Fuck my smaller version. Sadness, grief, anger, everything was pressing down by my naive, inexperienced, young mind, that thought  I am strong enough to handle this alone. 

Well, now I know I was wrong. I wasn't strong enough. Suppressing everything made me feel so miserable, that I can't cry now. I also can't truly laugh. My self esteem doesn't exist and, oh God, I think that suicide is probably the only way to get out of that loop. 

I am writing this because I need to vent my emotions and I am also curious, if anybody else can relate. Thank you, I wish you all good night.",I'm writing this post because I'm struggling with depression.

"I am 18F and I live with my bf in my moms house. He’d been out of work for 7 months and I got used to that. For some background I have been suicidal and depressed for 10 years now. I thought I had been getting better, I was fine for about a year. But recently life feels absolutely pointless again. I forgot how this felt. But since my bf started working, I feel completely useless. He’s working so we can move out together, but I don’t even look forward to that anymore. I’ve had two prior suicide attempts. One by drowning and one by hanging. Survived both obviously. I am not dealing with hitting rock bottom, not again. Nothing interests me and idk what I’m doing with my life. College sucks and I don’t even know if I can achieve the career I want. It’s all so pointless. I hurt everyday, and I’ve been thinking about ending it all again recently. I’ve got a train station by my house I could jump into. I’ve got trees to hang myself on, pills to take. Many ways. Just where and when.. I’m a stickler for trying to plan the details.

I will NOT go through hitting rock bottom again.",I’m writing to you because I’m feeling suicidal again.
I’m tired of going to bars and parties and just feeling like an unattractive blob. I want to go and find the love that they talk about on movies and tv but I no matter where I go I just feel like nothing. It’s not even that I can’t talk to people; I have some great conversations but it’s very clear that no one actually wants to be with me romantically. I know this sounds like a bullshit “friendzoning” thing but it’s impossible to feel good about how I look when no one else does.,I’m a 20-year-old woman and I’m bored.
